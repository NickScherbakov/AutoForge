## 💡 Key Implementation Decisions

### 1. Form-Based Editor (MVP)
**Decision**: Use simple form-based workflow creator instead of drag-and-drop
**Rationale**: Faster to implement, meets MVP requirements, upgradeable later
**Impact**: Full functionality achieved, future enhancement available

### 2. Celery for Background Jobs
**Decision**: Use Celery with Redis
**Rationale**: Proven solution, scalable, reliable
**Impact**: Excellent performance, easy to scale

### 3. Stripe Integration
**Decision**: Implement deposit API, charge on success
**Rationale**: Industry standard, secure, well-documented
**Impact**: Production-ready payment processing

### 4. Docker Compose
**Decision**: Provide complete Docker setup
**Rationale**: Easy deployment, consistent environments
**Impact**: One-command startup, portable
