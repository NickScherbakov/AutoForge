### Automation #2: Webhook Alert (Intermediate)

**What you'll build**: Receive Telegram notification when any service sends a webhook.

**Time**: 5 minutes  
**Cost**: $0.05 per notification

**Steps**:

1. **Create Telegram Bot** (one-time setup):
   - Open Telegram, search for @BotFather
   - Send `/newbot` and follow instructions
   - Copy your bot token
   - Get your chat ID: Message your bot, then visit:
     `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates`
   - Copy the `chat.id` value

   Trigger Type: Webhook
   ```

3. **Add Action**:
   ```
   Action Type: Telegram Message

```

**Result**: You'll receive a Telegram message instantly!

**Use this for**:

### Automation #3: API Health Monitor (Advanced)

**What you'll build**: Check if your website/API is up every 5 minutes.

**Time**: 5 minutes  
**Cost**: $0.05 per check √ó 288 checks/day = $14.40/day

**Steps**:

1. **Create Workflow**:
   ```
   Name: API Health Check
   Description: Monitor uptime every 5 minutes
   Trigger Type: Schedule
   Cron Expression: */5 * * * *
   Timezone: UTC
   ```

2. **Add First Action** (Check API):
   ```
   Action Type: HTTP Request
   URL: https://your-api.com/health
   Method: GET
   Headers: (if needed)
     Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
   ```

3. **Add Second Action** (Alert if Down):
   ```
   Action Type: Telegram Message
   Chat ID: Your chat ID
   Message:
   üö® API DOWN!
   
   URL: https://your-api.com/health
   Time: {{timestamp}}
   Status: {{status_code}}
   
   Check it now!
   ```

4. **Set Cost**: 0.05
5. **Create and Activate**

**Result**: You'll be alerted within 5 minutes if your API goes down!

**Note**: This costs ~$432/month for 24/7 monitoring. For lighter monitoring:
- Every 15 minutes: `*/15 * * * *` = $144/month
- Every hour: `0 * * * *` = $36/month
- Business hours only: `0 9-17 * * 1-5` = $6/month

## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Test with Manual Trigger First
- Create workflow with any trigger type
- Use "Execute Now" button to test
- Verify actions work correctly
- Then switch to webhook/schedule trigger

### Tip 2: Start with Low-Cost Actions
- Email: $0.05-$0.10
- Telegram: $0.05
- Simple HTTP: $0.05
- Test thoroughly before scaling up

### Tip 3: Use Variables in Messages
Available variables:
- `{{timestamp}}` - Current time
- `{{date}}` - Current date
- `{{webhook_data}}` - Data from webhook
- `{{status_code}}` - HTTP response code
- Custom variables from API responses

Example:
```
Hi {{customer_name}},
Your order {{order_id}} shipped!
Track it: {{tracking_url}}
```

### Tip 4: Monitor Your Executions
- Check dashboard regularly
- Review execution logs
- Look for failed executions (free!)
- Optimize costs based on usage

### Tip 5: Set Realistic Costs
- Start conservative: $0.05
- Monitor execution success rate
- Increase if workflow is valuable
- Decrease for testing

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending
1. Check SMTP settings in backend/.env
2. Verify recipient email is correct
3. Check spam folder
4. Look at execution log for errors

### Telegram Not Working
1. Verify bot token is correct
2. Ensure you've messaged the bot first
3. Confirm chat ID is correct (use getUpdates)
4. Check bot has permission to message you

### Webhook Not Triggering
1. Verify webhook URL is correct
2. Check workflow is activated
3. Ensure POST request with JSON body
4. Look for webhook in execution history

### Schedule Not Running
1. Verify cron expression syntax
2. Check Celery beat is running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```
3. Look for scheduled tasks in logs
4. Ensure workflow is activated

## üìä Cost Management

### Understand Your Costs

**Low Cost Workflows** ($0.05-$0.10):
- Simple notifications
- Single action workflows
- Low-value automations

**Medium Cost Workflows** ($0.10-$0.25):
- Multi-action sequences
- Business-critical notifications
- Customer-facing automations

**High Cost Workflows** ($0.25-$0.50):
- Complex multi-step processes
- High-value business automation
- Revenue-generating workflows

### Calculate Monthly Costs

Formula: `Executions per month √ó Cost per execution`

Examples:
- Daily email (30/month) √ó $0.05 = $1.50/month
- Order notifications (100/month) √ó $0.10 = $10/month
- API monitoring (8,640/month) √ó $0.05 = $432/month

### Optimize Costs

1. **Reduce Frequency**:
   - Every 5 min ‚Üí Every 15 min = 66% savings
   - 24/7 ‚Üí Business hours only = 65% savings

2. **Batch Operations**:
   - Check 1 item at a time vs check all items once
   - Single daily summary vs multiple individual emails

3. **Use Manual Triggers**:
   - On-demand reports instead of scheduled
   - Pay only when needed

4. **Monitor Failed Executions**:
   - Failed executions are FREE
   - Fix issues, don't pay for failures
