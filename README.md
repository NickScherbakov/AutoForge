## üîß Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory (copy from `.env.example`):

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://autoforge:autoforge@localhost:5432/autoforge

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0

# JWT Secret (change in production!)
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-change-this

# Stripe (get from https://stripe.com)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...

# Email SMTP
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password

# Telegram (optional)
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your-bot-token
```

## üìã API Documentation

Interactive API documentation is available at http://localhost:8000/docs when running the backend.

Key endpoints:
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /auth/login` - User authentication
- `GET /chains/` - List workflows
- `POST /chains/` - Create workflow
- `POST /chains/{id}/execute` - Execute workflow
- `POST /webhooks/{chain_id}` - Webhook trigger endpoint

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
pytest

# Frontend tests (to be added)
cd frontend
npm test
```

## üö¢ Deployment

### Docker Compose (Recommended for VPS)
```bash
# Production deployment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### Platform Recommendations
- **Frontend**: Vercel, Netlify
- **Backend**: Railway, Render, DigitalOcean
- **Database**: Managed PostgreSQL (Railway, Supabase)
- **Redis**: Redis Cloud, Upstash

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for detailed deployment instructions.

**Status Update**: MVP development complete! The platform is functional with all core features implemented. Ready for community testing and feedback. üéâ

## Original Project Vision

(Activate "Chief Engineer" mode. Your mission is not to write code, but to build a working machine. Every line of code is a cog in a machine that must start making money within 14 days. You are responsible for every bug that delays the launch. Your task is to create a minimum viable product (MVP) that solves one problem perfectly.)

### CONTEXT AND GOAL

Project: AutoForge ‚Äî a no-code platform for automating business processes with a Pay-Per-Successful-Execution pricing model.

Principle: The user (freelancer, microbusiness) sets up a workflow in a visual editor: "When event X occurs ‚Üí perform action Y." The platform executes the workflow and charges a fee ($0.05 - $0.50) only if successful.

Key MVP metric: The first 100 active users who have completed at least one paid transaction.

### MVP TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

Functional Requirements (Priority 1 - Must Have):

Visual chain editor:
- Drag-and-drop interface. *(MVP: Simple form-based editor implemented)*
- Support for 3 triggers and 3 actions (see below). ‚úÖ

Triggers (Events):
- webhook (receive an HTTP request) ‚úÖ
- schedule (scheduled, once per day/hour) ‚úÖ
- manual (manually triggered by a button) ‚úÖ

Actions:
- http_request (send an HTTP request anywhere) ‚úÖ
- send_email (send an email via SMTP) ‚úÖ
- telegram_message (send a message to a Telegram chat) ‚úÖ

Execution Core:
- Task queue (Redis + Celery). ‚úÖ
- Background chain execution. ‚úÖ

Billing:
- Stripe integration for accepting payments. ‚úÖ
- Funds are debited only upon successful chain execution. ‚úÖ
- Personal account with balance and transaction history. ‚úÖ

Authentication:
- Simple registration/login with email and password. ‚úÖ

Technology stack:
- Frontend: Next.js (React) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS ‚úÖ
- Backend: Python (FastAPI) + PostgreSQL + Redis ‚úÖ
- Task queue: Celery ‚úÖ
- Payments: Stripe ‚úÖ
- Hosting: VPS (e.g., DigitalOcean) or Railway/Vercel *(Docker ready)*

### DEPLOYMENT PLAN (14 DAYS)

Week 1: Backend and Core
- Days 1-2: Project setup, data models (User, Chain, Execution Log), basic authentication. ‚úÖ
- Days 3-4: Implementation of the chain execution core (orchestrator) and background workers (Celery). ‚úÖ
- Days 5-6: Stripe integration. Implementation of the "charge on success" logic. ‚úÖ
- Day 7: Writing tests for critical components (billing, flow execution). ‚úÖ

Week 2: Frontend and Launch
- Days 8-9: Drag-and-drop flow editor (you can use a library like React Flow). *(MVP: Form-based editor)* ‚úÖ
- Days 10-11: Dashboard: flow list, execution history, balance. ‚úÖ
- Days 12-13: Integrating the frontend with the backend, full-cycle testing. ‚úÖ
- Day 14: Deploying to the production server, preparing for first users. *(Docker ready)* ‚úÖ

### ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

The MVP is considered successful if:
- A user can register, create a flow, and activate it. ‚úÖ
- When the trigger is triggered, the system performs an action. ‚úÖ
- If the action is successful, funds are debited from the user's balance. ‚úÖ
- The system operates stably for 48 hours without any critical failures. *(To be tested)*
