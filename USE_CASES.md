   - On-demand (manual)

2. **Actions**: What needs to happen?
   - Send notification
   - Update database

## üí∞ Pricing Philosophy

### Why Pay-Per-Success Works

**Traditional Model Problems**:
- Pay $20-$100/month whether you use it or not
- Failed workflows still cost money
- Pressure to use it to justify cost
- Overprovisioning "just in case"

**AutoForge Model Benefits**:
- Pay only when workflows succeed
- Failed runs = $0 cost
- Scale up/down without penalty
- True pay-as-you-grow pricing

### Real Cost Examples

**Light Usage** (10 executions/month):
- Cost: $0.50 - $5.00/month
- Traditional: $20/month minimum
- **Save $15-$19.50/month**

**Medium Usage** (100 executions/month):
- Cost: $5 - $50/month
- Traditional: $50/month
- **Save $0-$45/month** (plus free failed runs)

**Heavy Usage** (1,000 executions/month):
- Cost: $50 - $500/month
- Traditional: $100-$300/month (with overage fees)
- **Save varies, but no surprise bills**
